👁️ Face Detection using OpenCV & Haar Cascades
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using Haar Cascade Classifiers with OpenCV in Python. 
The goal is to detect human faces in images and video streams by leveraging classical computer vision techniques. 
It's a beginner-friendly yet powerful application of object detection that forms the foundation for more advanced tasks like facial recognition, emotion analysis, and face tracking.
